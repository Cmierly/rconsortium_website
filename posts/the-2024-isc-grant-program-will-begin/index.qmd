The R Consortium is excited to announce the second cycle of the 2024 Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) Grants Program. The [Call for Proposals will open soon](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/call-for-proposals). This initiative aims to support projects that strengthen the R ecosystem’s technical and social infrastructure. 

Here is a [list of projects that received grants from the R Consortium in the First Cycle in 2024](https://www.r-consortium.org/all-projects/awarded-projects/2024-group-1). 

From the Call for Proposals page:

The ISC is interested in projects that:

-   Are likely to have a broad impact on the R community.
-   Have a focused scope (a good example is the [Simple Features for R project](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)). If you have a larger project, consider breaking it up into smaller chunks (a good example of this done is with the [DBI/DBItest project](http://dbi.r-dbi.org/) submission, where multiple proposals came in over time to address the various needs).
-   Have a low-to-medium risk with a low-to-medium reward. The ISC tends not fund high-risk, high-reward projects.

Whether you’re working on groundbreaking tools or organizing community-driven events, this is your chance to secure funding and make a significant impact on the R community!
