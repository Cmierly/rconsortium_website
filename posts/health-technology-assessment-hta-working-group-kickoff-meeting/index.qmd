Gregory Chen and Anders Gorst-Rasmussen opened the meeting with a vision of collaboration, emphasizing the importance of a shared, flexible structure within the HTA Working Group. The co-chairs highlighted two initial workstreams designed to channel the group’s efforts without restricting the scope of potential projects. This framework underscores the group’s commitment to evolve in response to member feedback and industry needs.

## Workstream 1: Building Connections Across the HTA Ecosystem

Anders Gorst-Rasmussen and Dominic Muston introduced the first workstream, focusing on building connections across diverse stakeholders within HTA. This foundational effort aims to foster a common perspective and identify relevant challenges and opportunities. By bridging gaps between different sectors within HTA, Workstream 1 seeks to create a solid framework for addressing complex issues in health technology evaluation and supporting innovation across the industry.

## Workstream 2: R Tools for HTA – Identification, Curation, and Education

Gregory Chen and Joseph Rickert presented Workstream 2, which takes a hands-on approach toward bolstering R’s role in HTA. Key goals include identifying relevant R packages, curating high-quality, production-ready tools, and proactively enhancing documentation and user resources. The working group will also promote these tools through blogs, webinars, and other educational efforts to foster a culture of learning and improvement around R for HTA.
The ultimate aim is to ensure that the HTA community has access to well-documented, robust R tools and resources that meet industry needs.

## Next Steps: How Members Can Contribute
The HTA Working Group’s GitHub repository serves as the central hub for collaboration, providing access to meeting materials, discussion threads, and project updates. Members are encouraged to engage actively by commenting on[ Issue #1](https://github.com/RConsortium/HTA-wg) with a brief statement about their backgrounds, opening new issues to propose ideas, and suggesting solutions to emerging challenges. This repository promises to be a lively and evolving resource as the working group’s projects advance.

## Group Discussion: Setting the Foundation for Future Initiatives
The group discussion allowed members to share insights, generate new ideas, and identify priorities for the working group’s next steps. The discussion was lively and constructive, underscoring the potential of this initiative to drive meaningful contributions to the HTA field.
