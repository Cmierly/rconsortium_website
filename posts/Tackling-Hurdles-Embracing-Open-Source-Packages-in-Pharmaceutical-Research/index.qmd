In the dynamic field of pharmaceutical research, open source R packages offer incredible potential to innovate and enhance efficiency. The R Validation Hub is guiding the community building [riskmetric](https://github.com/pharmar/riskmetric) and the [riskassessment](https://github.com/pharmar/riskassessment) app. riskmetric is a framework to quantify an R package’s “risk of use” by assessing a number of meaningful metrics designed to evaluate package development best practices, code documentation, community engagement, and development sustainability. Together, the riskassessment app and the riskmetric package aim to provide some context for validation within regulated industries. 

The benefits of utilizing open source tools in pharmaceutical projects are compelling. To address these issues and maximize their potential, join us at the R Validation Hub community meeting on May 21st at 12:00 PM EST. This gathering will focus on sharing best practices, troubleshooting common problems, and exploring innovative solutions together.

Embrace the opportunity to transform pharmaceutical research with us. Let’s innovate, collaborate, and overcome these hurdles together.
