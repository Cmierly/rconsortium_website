Datacove is pleased to announce the availability of tickets for the upcoming EARL (Enterprise Applications of the R Language) conference. 

The EARL conference is a cross-sector event that will be held at the Grand Hotel in Brighton. This venue promises to provide attendees with a blend of Victorian elegance and modern conference facilities over three days, from the 3rd to the 5th of September 2024. The conference schedule includes high-quality workshops on the first day (3rd September) and two days of presentations and talks (4th – 5th September). An evening networking event is planned for the 4th of September at the British Airways i360 venue, offering attendees the opportunity to connect with peers and speakers in a relaxed setting.

We are offering tickets at a reduced early bird rate. Additionally, we provide discounts for government employees, NHS staff, charity workers, academics, and those making bulk purchases.
