# Cakes, Code, and Community: Rasmus Bååth’s Secret to Reviving the CopenhagenR UseR Group

[Rasmus Bååth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rasmus-baath/), the organizer of 
the [CopenhagenR UseR Group](https://www.meetup.com/copenhagenr-user-group/), 
recently spoke to the R Consortium about his experience in organizing the group. 
After joining the Copenhagen R User Group in 2013, he took the lead in reviving 
the group in 2023 after a period of inactivity. Under his guidance, the group 
now focuses on industry-related topics, personal projects, and emerging tools 
like Quarto. Rasmus is dedicated to fostering a vibrant local R community 
through in-person meetups that encourage learning and collaboration.

The CopenhagenR UseR Group is hosting an exciting 
“[Two Tools for Report Generation in R](https://www.meetup.com/copenhagenr-user-group/events/303309816/)” event 
on October 3, 2024. The event will feature two presentations on using Sweave and 
Quarto for report generation, followed by discussions and networking at 
[PROSA](https://www.prosa.dk/), København, Denmark.

**Please share your background and involvement with the RUGS group.**

I currently work as a Data Science Manager at Normative.io. I've used R on 
and off for about 15 or 16 years. It all started when I was doing my bachelor's 
in academia and needed to plot a histogram. At that time, plotting a histogram 
in Excel wasn't easy, so my supervisor suggested trying out R. I gave it a 
shot and got hooked. After that, I pursued a PhD in cognitive science, where 
I used R extensively for statistical analysis.

I used R for a lot of graphing during my academic years. After academia, I 
became a data scientist in the industry, and R was my preferred tool. I work 
with R and Python, depending on the job's requirements. In 2013, there were 
no R meetups in the south of Sweden where I live. I found out about an R 
meetup in Copenhagen and decided to attend. There, I met 
[Kenneth Rose](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennethrose82/), the organizer, 
who was full of energy and charisma. It was a fun group, so I started 
attending regularly despite the commute from Sweden to Copenhagen. 
Kenneth was very active and enthusiastic in running the meetup group.

After a couple of years, the group's activity declined. A new organizer revived 
the group, but COVID hit, ending the meetups. The group had been around for ten 
years by 2023, and I felt it was a shame to let it die. I decided to restart it, 
and now we have a small but active group. We enjoy discussing industry-related 
topics and personal projects.

**Can you share what the local R community is like?**

It is the Copenhagen meetup group located in Denmark. However, I can speak for 
Denmark and Sweden since I live in Sweden. R is widely used in academia and is 
considered the language of choice for statistics. Python is more prevalent in 
the industry due to the large number of programmers who are familiar with the 
language. In Denmark, the pharmaceutical industry is significant. R is still 
widely used there due to its close ties to academia and the specific requirements 
for reporting, statistics, and visualization, in which R excels.

**Do you guys host online or in-person events?**

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we tried some online events, but creating a 
sense of community online with so much content is challenging. I believe 
online events are great, and people should consider them. However, we also 
recognize the need for in-person events. For those unable to attend, there 
is plenty of valuable content online. We don't have the setup to record events, 
but we would consider doing so if feasible.

**You have a Meetup titled “[Two tools for report generation in R](https://www.meetup.com/copenhagenr-user-group/events/303309816/).” Can you share more on the topic covered? Why this topic?**

Our next meetup will focus on automatic reporting in R. We'll have two 
speakers: [Dmytro Perepolkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dperepolkin/) and 
an anonymous speaker. The anonymous speaker will present 
on [Sweave](https://rpubs.com/YaRrr/SweaveIntro), an older tool used to 
generate reports in R, while Dmytro will present on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), 
a more recent and popular tool for combining R code and text. This meetup will 
depart from the usual topics, focusing on automatic reporting rather than 
visualization.

I'm looking forward to our upcoming event. It will be a history lesson 
and a great opportunity to learn about a useful minimalistic tool (Sweave). 
I'm also excited about Quarto and the potential for new developments. We 
could have a Quarto meetup every year to stay updated with the latest 
advancements. The meetup will feature different presentations, including 
introductions to new tools and discussions about projects and code. 
It will be a great way to learn and connect with others in the field.

**What are some of the popular R-related topics in the group?**

The topics we typically cover are where R is at its strongest. We often 
discuss personal projects, and although I wonder if they receive a great 
response, I love them. Additionally, we frequently explore new tools and 
libraries, particularly those related to dashboarding, Shiny, and 
visualization. Presentations are highly technical, and I've noticed that our 
audience may not be accustomed to text-heavy or math-intensive presentations. 
Therefore, topics such as statistics and statistics packages might not 
receive as much attention despite my interest in them. Surprisingly, 
machine learning is not a common focus at our meetups, as most speakers 
are more inclined towards visualization, reporting, and statistics rather 
than machine learning.

**Do you recommend any techniques for planning for or during the event? (GitHub, Zoom, other.) Can these techniques be used to make your group more inclusive to people who cannot attend physical events in the future?**

There are three key components needed to get started with organizing an 
event. First, you need people who are interested in attending your event. 
It can be challenging if you're in a small town or a location where it's 
difficult to attract attendees. Second, you need to secure speakers who 
are willing to participate. Lastly, finding a suitable venue is crucial. 
Having a reliable and cost-free location for your event is essential. 
We were fortunate to secure a free venue through a union for IT workers 
in Copenhagen, which aligns with our goal of offering free courses without 
being tied to a specific company.

Finding speakers can be challenging, but constantly contacting and asking 
for volunteers is the best approach. To make it easier for potential 
speakers, consider organizing events where multiple speakers can do 
shorter presentations, which may be less intimidating than a full-hour 
presentation. However, attracting speakers and attendees remains the 
most difficult aspect of organizing events. Nevertheless, securing a 
dependable venue is a great starting point.

And then there are some small things. Make sure to make nice announcements. 
They need a nice picture. They need friendly text so that people feel 
welcome. That's the minimal thing. And the other thing is, if it’s 
allowed in the meetup space, bring some cakes or cookies and have some 
snacks. If people know there will be a little bit of snacks, they're 
more likely to show up. So it's a small thing, but I think that helps. 
This meetup is in Copenhagen, and I'm from Sweden. However, Denmark and 
Copenhagen have a special relationship with beer. I distinctly remember 
my first Copenhagen meetup when Kenneth Rose was the organizer. Back 
then, he brought a big case of beer cans to each meetup, and everyone 
was having a nice time. I don't say you need a beer at your meetup, but 
bringing drinks and snacks is always nice.
