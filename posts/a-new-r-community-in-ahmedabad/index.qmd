**Please share about your background and involvement with the RUGS group.**

I’ve been working in statistical programming and data sciences in the clinical research industry for more than 14 years, which naturally led me to explore tools that enhance data analysis and visualization. My journey with the Ahmedabad R Users Group (ARUG) began when I recognized the growing need for a dedicated community focused on applying R in our field. I was sitting with my industry friends [Paresh Parekh](http://linkedin.com/in/paresh-parekh-16734817), [Paresh Paghdar](http://linkedin.com/in/paresh-p-a2352825), [Parin Shah](http://linkedin.com/in/parin-shah-98886928), and [Rahul Pandya](http://linkedin.com/in/rapandya), discussing what we could do to bring the Ahmedabad R community together. After a few days, when we met again, I proposed setting up the ARUG. They welcomed and fully supported the vision. 

While the group was initially formed in 2021, its formal setup was completed in 2023 with collaboration from the R Consortium. Since then, I’ve been organizing events, facilitating discussions, and contributing to the group’s growth. My passion for data science and community building drives my commitment to ARUG. Beyond organizing, I also mentor new members, helping them navigate the complexities of R. It’s incredibly rewarding to see the community thrive and to witness the impact of our collective efforts on advancing the field. ARUG is the first city-based group in India associated with R Consortium and the only R user group focused on Clinical Research & Pharmaceutical Industries.

These hobbies provide a balanced and enriching life, complementing my professional endeavors.

Apart from ARUG, I volunteer with organizations like [CDISC](https://www.cdisc.org/), [PHUSE](https://phuse.global/), [Pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.org/), and [RinPharma](https://rinpharma.com/), contributing to various projects such as [SDTM IG v3.4 development](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtmig/sdtmig-v3-4), [CDISC Primer development](https://www.cdisc.org/primer), and [Shiny for Submission](https://learn.rinpharma.com/shiny4submissions.html). These experiences offer me a unique perspective and a sense of tranquility that I bring into my work, enhancing my creativity and problem-solving abilities. Engaging in these activities helps me maintain a holistic approach to my professional and personal life.

I cherish spending time with my family, especially with my adorable daughter Saanvi. My better half, Niza, always supports and encourages me in all aspects of life. She is dedicated to taking care of our family and provides unwavering support that allows me to pursue my passions and professional goals.
