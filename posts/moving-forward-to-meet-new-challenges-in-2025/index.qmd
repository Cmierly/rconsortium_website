It has been a momentous year for the R Consortium, and we are very
grateful for the engagement and support we have received from our member
sponsors and all the members of the R community.

## 76,048 members, 91 R User Groups, 39 countries, 6 continents

![](RUGS-nov-2024.png)

Our [R User Groups program](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/rugsprogram.html) is better than
ever! We helped to support a lot of you out there learning and sharing
the R language. It is exciting to see this type of activity and we hope
that in 2025, these groups will continue to grow and that we can sponsor
new groups, too. We are always looking for more and better ways to
support the community. We hope that you will let us know your
suggestions for helping to grow the R community in your area.

## Working Groups and Top-Level Projects delivering progress and access

Many of our working groups and projects had solid wins this year in
pushing forward on their projects.

-   Our Submissions working group achieved its [fourth successful
    submission with the
    FDA](https://r-consortium.org/posts/using-r-to-submit-research-to-the-fda-pilot-4-successfully-submitted/)
    -- the first to feature WebAssembly to bundle a Shiny application
    into a self-contained package.

-   We kicked off our [Health Technology Assessment (HTA) working
    group](https://r-consortium.org/posts/health-technology-assessment-hta-working-group-kickoff-meeting/)
    with two workstreams (1. Stakeholder and landscape mapping and
    opportunity assessment & 2. R Tools for HTA -- Identification,
    Curation, and Education) addressing issues in health technology
    evaluation and building a well-documented resource for robust R
    tools in HTA.

-   Multilingual R Documentation has published its first package
    [rhelpi18n](https://github.com/eliocamp/rhelpi18n) adding
    multilingual documentation support. This effort is a [co-sponsored
    project](https://ropensci.org/multilingual-publishing/) with
    [rOpenSci](https://www.ropensci.org) and the [Chan-Zuckerberg
    Initiative's Open Science Program](https://czi.co/OpenScience),

-   We have added [R-universe as a new Top-Level
    Project](https://r-consortium.org/posts/r-universe-named-r-consortiums-newest-top-level-project/).
    R-universe provides a searchable catalog for R software, articles,
    datasets, anywhere in the ecosystem, and it is an open platform for
    running CRAN-like package repositories.Â We are thrilled to be
    working with rOpenSci on this important infrastructure project for
    the R community.

## Quarto powered website

We must brag about our beautiful new Quarto-based website that we
launched this year. Performance was increased by 65% faster overall, with homepage load times going from 2.3 seconds to 0.8 seconds on average in testing. The
team did a wonderful job, and we invite the community to [join us in
contributing to the
site.](https://github.com/RConsortium/rconsortium_website#contributing-to-this-website)
This is a great opportunity for first time contributors and for others
to get a chance to work with a Quarto site.

## Expanding support for the R language and infrastructure

The Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) funds two grant cycles per
year for projects that support the development of the R language and the
maintenance of its infrastructure. We funded [13 new projects in
2024](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/funded-projects.html). We
have dispersed technical grants totaling almost \$1.5 million since our
founding. Our next grant cycle will re-open March 1, 2025, and now is a
great time to [contact the ISC to start the
process](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/callforproposals.html).

## Events IRL and digital were huge wins for all of us!

Live events are a great way to share new developments and raise
awareness of what our community needs or wants. The R Consortium
sponsored 12 events this year, and we are looking forward to seeing a
lot of you next year at [R/Medicine June
10-13](https://rconsortium.github.io/RMedicine_website/) and useR!
August 8-10. To access all the digital events and webinar content we
produce, please [subscribe to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@RConsortium) so you are sure to get
new videos as we post them.

## New year, new opportunities and challenges

I encourage you to register for [R/Medicine June
10-13](https://rconsortium.github.io/RMedicine_website/) and **SAVE THE
DATE for useR!** at Duke University August 8-10. We are looking forward
to all the great programming in 2025 and [would love to hear from the
community any
requests/ideas](https://r-consortium.org/about/contact.html) for content
you would like to see.

Finally, [our mission in support of the R language and its
community](https://r-consortium.org/about/) is at the core of everything
we do. This means we need to answer new challenges that face both. The
recently passed [Cyber Resilience
Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act)
will require CRAN and all community repositories to make changes to meet
its requirements for distribution of packages in the EU. We are asking now for financial support to ensure that we, in coordination with the Linux Foundation, can assist all our repositories to plan and work toward compliance by October of 2027. We hope that you will consider either [renewing your support at a higher level or start supporting us](https://r-consortium.org/about/join.html#joining-the-r-consortium-is-easy) by becoming a new member-sponsor for the R Consortium today.

To our current
members, we thank you for your support and ask you to consider renewing
your support at the next level. 

If you\'re considering becoming a
member-sponsor of the R Consortium, feel free to reach out to me
