The R Consortium is proud to announce our newest top level project, [R-Universe](https://r-universe.dev/search). R-universe is a platform for improving publication and discovery of research software in R, developed by rOpenSci.

Critical R community projects that need support over a longer time period are evaluated by the Infrastructure Steering Committee (ISC) for long-term status. Being designated Top Level gives a project guaranteed funding for 3 years, along with a voting seat on the ISC. 

“The ability to find and evaluate high quality R packages is important to the R community, and the R Consortium is pleased to support the R-Universe project with a long-term commitment to help strengthen the foundation of the R package ecosystem,” said Terry Christiani, R Consortium executive director. “We are pleased to be working more closely together with rOpenSci on this effort.”

R-Universe will be joining R Consortium’s three current Top Level Projects:

* [DBI](https://r-dbi.org/) - R’s interface to databases
* [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) - Promoting diversity in the R community with 200+ groups worldwide
* [R User Group Support Program (RUGS)](https://r-consortium.org/all-projects/rugsprogram.html) - facilitating person-to-person exchange of knowledge in small group settings on a global scale

“R-universe provides a searchable catalog for R software, articles, datasets, anywhere in the ecosystem, and it is an open platform for running CRAN-like package repositories ranging from personal to lab to industry-scale production to make your work visible and accessible to a big audience, with or without CRAN,” said Noam Ross, rOpenSci executive director. “We are very excited to continue to strengthen R infrastructure and work closely with the R Consortium.”

R-universe allows users and developers of R packages to:

* **Discover:** R-universe provides a searchable catalog for R software, articles, datasets, anywhere in the ecosystem. It is indexed and ranked using R specific features.
* **Learn:** R-universe serves rendered material and extensive background information to learn about a package and get started using it.
* **Publish:** R-universe is an open platform for running personal CRAN-like package repositories to make work public and accessible to a big audience, with or without CRAN.
* **Develop:** R-universe provides a zero-config development environment for continuous integration (identify upcoming breakage before release), experimental R features, new platforms such as WebAssembly, and more.
