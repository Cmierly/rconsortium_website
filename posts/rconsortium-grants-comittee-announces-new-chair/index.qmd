The R Consortium is pleased to announce that Katherine Jeschke has been appointed Chair of the Grants Committee.

She will oversee day-to-day grant processes for both pre- and post-awards, ensuring grants meet the R Consortium’s strategic objectives. Katherine will report to the Executive Director and work closely with the Infrastructure Steering Committee and the RUGS program to track grants and help improve the effectiveness of R Consortium grants in supporting the R Community.

Katherine’s non-profit grants and administration skills were honed over more than 25 years of experience in marketing communications, and staff, budget, development, and grants management for non-profits and trade organizations, as well as corporate and public sector consulting organizations. 

She holds an MA degree in American History and Museum Administration from George Washington University and a BA degree in Fine Arts and Art History from the University of Maryland.

“Getting acquainted with our various grants and procedures while evaluating the strategic effectiveness of R Consortium grants is a big undertaking, but her background and years of experience should ease her way,” said Joseph Rickert, Executive Director of the R Consortium.
