R-Hub was a platform for simplifying and improving the R package development process.

R-Hub assisted R package developers by providing facilities to test packages across multiple 
architectures, build binaries, and publish, distribute and maintain their packages. Developed by 
[Gábor Csárdi](https://gaborcsardi.org/), it was being leveraged by R package developers to improve the quality of their packages 
and to enable support for their packages across multiple architectures.
