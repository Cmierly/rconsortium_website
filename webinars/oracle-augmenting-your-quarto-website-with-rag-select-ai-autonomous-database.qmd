## Abstract

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) combines vector search with generative AI – enabling more relevant and up-to-date responses from your large language model (LLM). In this session, we highlight augmenting a Quarto website to accept a natural language prompt and display the response generated using an LLM, text transformer, and vector store. Specifically, this scenario uses the Select AI and AI Vector Search features of Oracle Autonomous Database 23ai. Select AI automates vector index creation leveraging AI Vector Search directly in your database. Select AI automates the orchestration process to enable RAG. Our scenario leverages R Consortium content from blogs and their new Quarto website for the demonstration.
