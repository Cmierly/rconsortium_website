It provided a fully transparent, open source code base in R and Python. The website provides the tools for students to learn about empirical applications based on a fully transparent code base and for instructors the materials for teaching the importance of reproducible research using tidy principles.

Christoph Scheuch introduces Tidy Finance and illustrates the underlying principles. The webinar then focuses on accessing and managing financial data using R. It shows how to import different open source and proprietary data sets and organize them in a database.
