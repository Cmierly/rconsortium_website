This webinar focused on the {ggsurvfit} R package, a tool designed to simplify the creation of time-to-event or survival analysis summary figures using {ggplot2}. It emphasized the package’s capability to produce high-quality, publication-ready Kaplan-Meier plots and other survival analysis figures with ease and efficiency. Overall, the webinar promised to be an informative session for statisticians, data analysts, and researchers interested in survival analysis, offering insights into how {ggsurvfit} could enhance their data visualization capabilities in R.
