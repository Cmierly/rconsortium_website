## Summary 

In this talk, Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel, Professor of the Practice of Statistical Science at Duke University,  presents a new capability in Quarto that provides a straightforward and user-friendly approach to creating reproducible manuscripts that are publication-ready for submission to science journals. 

This new feature, Quarto manuscripts, includes the ability to produce a bundled output containing a standardized journal format, source documents, source computations, referenced resources, and execution information into a single bundle that be ingested into journal review and production processes. 

In this talk, we’ll demo how Quarto manuscripts work and how you can incorporate them into your current manuscript development process as well as touch on pain points in your current workflow that Quarto manuscripts help alleviate.
