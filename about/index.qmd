# R Consortium Mission Statement

The R Consortium promotes the growth and development of the R language and its ecosystem by supporting technical and social infrastructure, fostering community engagement, and driving industry adoption. 


We work to ensure a thriving, diverse global R community by providing resources, facilitating collaboration, and advocating for the use of R in multiple industry sectors.

We provide funding for technical infrastructure through grants and working groups.

We provide funding for social infrastructure through grants for R user groups and events around the world.

We provide a neutral space where industry, academia, and government can collaborate on mission critical processes and standards.
